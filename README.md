# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

About this app - This app is a reflection of a great passion of mine and that is to bring awareness to ours nations biggest cancer, and that is police brutality. The police are allowed to unjustly kill thousands every year and this needs to stop. They are supposed to be this highly trained force for good, yet they can kill an 11 year old boy with a toy gun and use the phrase "I was in fear of my life" to be absolved of any responsibilty or the life they just took. While if I or any other citizen killed one of them and then said "I was in fear of my life". we would be thrown in jail forever.
We have allowed this 'above the law mentality' to fester into what is now a brutal score of unjust killings and unpunished deeds, and it has to stop. 
    
So with this app you will be able to see past instances of police using their power to subjugate and injure, instead of protect and serve. You will also be able to track the long list of police killings and sort it by state, city, date, age or any other filter. My hope is that we as a people stem the tide of murder and unjust brutality presented daily by our local police departments.
